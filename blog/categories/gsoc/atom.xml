    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After finishing my new EmpathyRosterModelAggregator implementation of the EmpathyRosterModel interface (<a href="https://github.com/lcontzen/empathy/tree/aggregator">aggregator branch in my github repo</a>), I moved all the concerned files to a new directory to have them as a new private library ((<a href="https://github.com/lcontzen/empathy/tree/libroster">libroster branch in my github repo</a>)). This is still in Empathy's tree, but it's ready to be transformed as an external lib.</p>

<p>I then started writing documentation with gtk-doc (<a href="https://github.com/lcontzen/empathy/tree/libroster-docs">libroster-docs branch in my github repo</a>). I lost a few days to get it working "thanks" to the fact that I passed --enable-gtk-docs to autogen.sh instead of --enable-gtk-doc. What a wonderful example of a PEBCAK error that can drive you insane.</p>

<p>I'm now going to finish the docs before trying to bind my library to GObject-Introspection. I'm also going to update my page on live.gnome.org and prepare my final GSoC blogpost.</p>

<p>Little spoiler about this blogpost: This GSoC has been an awesome experience.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, I finally finished the work to move the model logic out of EmpathyRosterView (<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=680302">bug #680302</a>) and all of this has been merged into master.</p>

<p>I then started to work on a new implementation of the EmpathyRosterModel interface : EmpathyRosterModelAggregator. This is of course pushed as a branch on my github account : <a href="https://github.com/lcontzen/empathy/commits/aggregator">https://github.com/lcontzen/empathy/commits/aggregator</a>.</p>

<p>Quite short post, but quite satisfying pogress.</p>

<p>PS: My mentor <a href="http://blog.desmottes.be/">Guillaume Desmottes</a> gave me my printed copy of the GNOME Outreach Program Yearbook 2012. It's even better than in PDF!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Not much to say in my weekly report this week. I continued my work on the model, went to Geneva for a family meeting (so couldn't work those days) and more of my work was merged into master.</p>

<p>I also dove back into FolksIndividual's code to add the display_name property. Since the last time I worked on it, Jeremy Whiting had made some progress on my first patch. I've now submitted an updated version (<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=651672#c21">bug #651672</a>).</p>

<p>I couldn't make it to GUADEC but I saw the (pdf version of the) <a href="http://www.gnome.org/news/2012/07/gnome-outreach-program-yearbook-2012/">GNOME Outreach Program Yearbook 2012</a> and it's great! Thanks to <a href="http://www.dgsiegel.net/">Daniel Siegel</a> and all the people who made this happen!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week my work on the model started to be merged in master!</p>

<p>Before coming back to Brussels I continued moving logic from the view into the model. I then reviewed my patches, submitted them on bugzilla (<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=680302">Bug #680302</a>) and those patches were merged into master \o/. I also documented my public API for gtk-doc.</p>

<p>My patch for the bug I mentionned last week about the top contacts group name has been reviewed, corrected and merged.</p>

<p>I'm now going to go on on my work on the model and dive back into FolksIndividual's code to try to complete my patch for the new display_name property.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, I'm on holidays in the French Alps. This doesn't mean that my GSoC is on hold, but it means that I'm enjoying a beautifull sight while coding :</p>

<p><a href="http://laurentc.be/pics/blog/station.jpg"><img class="center" src="http://laurentc.be/pics/blog/station_small.jpg" title="Holidays coding station" alt="Holidays coding station"></a></p>

<p>During this week, I've continued my work on EmpathyRosterModel and EmpathyRosterModelManager. The model now catches all the signals emitted by the manager previously catched by the view. It also now have all the functions needed to be able to completely rely on the model and remove every manager references in the view. As said in my previous post, all of this is pushed on github : <a href="https://github.com/lcontzen/empathy">lcontzen/empathy</a>.</p>

<p>On a side note, I found out that if all your top contacts are offline the group name isn't displayed and the top contacts are lost alone on the top of the roster. I reported it and submitted a patch fixing this behavior (<a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=679868">bug #679868</a>) (this still needs to be reviewed).</p>

<p>PS : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D1cap6yETA">Good news, everyone!</a> I passed my Midterm Evaluation! \o/</p>

<p>Bonus : a better picture of the beautifull sight :
